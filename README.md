# Tatl Skips Mod
This is a mod that prevent Tatl interruptions from happening. It does not include actual cutscenes like the one after Link gets transformed as a Deku after going through the first door. It affects the following:
- Interruptions where Tatl will bring up some short dialogs to serve as a hint, such as:
  - Approaching the pushable block in the bridges room in Woodfall Temple;
  - Approaching the pushable block at the Snowhead Temple entrance.
- Interruptions where Tatl will stop Link to get his attention, such as:
  - Getting closer to the fountain in Clock Town Fairy Fountain;
  - The hallway in the dark room in Woodfall Temple;
  - Moving along the path in Snowhead towards the temple.
- Cutscenes where Tatl moves to another position, such as:
  - Entering the central room in Woodfall Temple;
  - Entering the central room in Snowhead Temple through the Freezards room;
  - Going through the first door in Great Bay Temple.
